# Hello, I'm Zaira

## About Me - keep dreaming, keep learning

Learning never stops, and It's never too late to do it. 

I've been day-dreaming of delving into the world of coding for many years, but life's intricate dance has often led the way. 

Along the years, I've had diverse roles and responsibilities, with its challenges and accomplishments, in different parts of the world. I currently work on the accommodation and restaurant sector as a coordinator, and it's time to turn those dreams into reality. Life may have been in the middle, but now it's time to make coding a central part of my story.

I am currently on an exciting journey as a full stack developer with [4Geeks Academy](https://www.4geeksacademy.co/). I'm passionate about acquiring new skills and knowledge in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

## Why Coding?

With coding as my tool, fulfilling a dream, I envision creating solutions that make a difference, bringing about positive change and good into the world, whether it's through innovative applications, impactful websites, or contributions to the open-source community.  Even amidst personal challenges, my determination fuels this journey.

The thrill of problem-solving and creating something from scratch is what drives me forward.
